Now battles are waged between spies, and the small Din Republic boasts an especially capable young man known as Klaus. When Klaus loses his mentor (and de facto father), he is given the man's failed mission and told to assemble his own elite spy team to infiltrate the neighboring country. Klaus agrees…but his idea of “elite” seems more like “incompetent” and the girls he picks for his mission don't look like they could spy on someone ten feet away from them, much less infiltrate an enemy nation.

Too bad the kingdom that summoned him only got him by mistake. Not only was he not one of the three summoned heroes, but his stats were laughable compared to theirs. On top of that, there's something really sketchy about this kingdom. He immediately left to make his own way in this other world. The only thing Mukōda can rely on is his unique skill: the \"Online Supermarket,\" a skill that allows him to buy modern goods in a fantasy world. It's useless for combat, but if he plays his cards right, he could lead a comfortable life. At least, that's what Mukōda thinks, but it turns out modern food bought with this skill has some absurd effects. Mukouda introduces ridiculously tasty modern cooking to a fantasy world and gets some ridiculous repeat customers begging for more. (from manga)",

He is reborn into a distinguished family of wizards, but is judged to have no magical ability. He soon realizes however that the magic in this world is nothing compared to his old onmyō arts, and he declares that he doesn't need magic. He thus begins his easy life in another world with his onmyō arts and a multitude of yōkai creatures who follow him. (from manga)",
